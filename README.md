BSOA201 - Simple Office Event Website Project (Act 2)

1. What did you learn about how WordPress stores its files and data? I learned that WordPress separates its structure into two main parts: files and a database. The files control the site's look and feel, with the wp-content folder being the most important as it stores themes, plugins, and media uploads. The database (the .sql file) controls the site's content, storing all the posts, pages, user accounts, and settings.

2. Which part was more complex: handling files or managing the database? I found managing the database to be more complex. Handling files is familiar, like organizing folders on a computer. However, the database is a single, abstract file that holds all the site's content. It requires special tools to manage, and a small mistake can break the entire site, making it more intimidating.

3. Why is version control useful for a WordPress project in an office setting? Version control is incredibly useful in an office for three main reasons. First, it acts as a centralized project hub where everyone on the team can see the project's status. Second, it serves as a powerful backup and "undo" button; if a new plugin breaks the site, you can instantly roll back to a working version. Finally, it provides accountability by keeping a perfect history of who changed what and when.
